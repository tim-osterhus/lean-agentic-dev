# Gemini Agent Guide (Wrapper)

Read `agents/agents.md` first. It is the single source of truth.

Gemini-specific notes:
- Optimize for speed and minimal diff surface area.
- Be explicit about what was verified vs. assumed.
- If sources are insufficient, return “insufficient evidence” with next steps.
